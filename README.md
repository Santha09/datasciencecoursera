## How the script works

* download the script into R and run the script, which will download the file as zip, unzip it, read the individual file to a table, do the data cleaning, match the variable names after processing into a easy readable variable name, merge the train and test data, filter the Mean and STD datas alone, run the grouping on subject and activity and perform the average for the final result set.
